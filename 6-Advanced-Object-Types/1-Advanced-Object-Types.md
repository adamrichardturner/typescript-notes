# Advanced Object Types

## Interface Type

TypeScript allows you to specifically type an object using an interface that can be reused by multiple objects. To create an interface, use the interface keyword followed by the interface name and the typed object.

```typescript
interface Publication {
  isbn: string
  author: string
  publisher: string
}
```

## Interface Define Objects Only

In TypeScript, type aliases can define composite types such as objects and unions as well as primitive types such as numbers and strings; interface, however, can only define objects.

Interface is useful in typing objects written for object-oriented programs.

```typescript
// Type alias can define a union type
type ISBN = number | string

// Type alias can define an object type
type PublicationT = {
  isbn: ISBN
  author: string
  publisher: string
}

// Interface can only define an object type
interface PublicationI {
  isbn: ISBN
  author: string
  publisher: string
}
```

## Interface for Classes

To apply a TypeScript interface to a class, add the implements keyword after the class name followed by the interface name.

TypeScript will check and ensure that the object actually implements all the properties and methods defined inside the interface.

```typescript
interface Shape {
  area: number
  computeArea: () => number
}

const PI: number = 22 / 7

// Circle class implements the Shape interface
class Circle implements Shape {
  radius: number
  area: number
  constructor(radius: number) {
    this.radius = radius
    this.area = this.computeArea()
  }
  computeArea = (): number => {
    return PI * this.radius * this.radius
  }
}

let target = new Circle(3)
console.log(target.area.toFixed(2)) // Prints "28.29"
```

## Nested Interface

TypeScript allows both type aliases and interface to be nested. An object typed with a nested interface should have all its properties structured the same way as the interface definition.

```typescript
// This is a nested interface
interface Course {
  description: {
    name: string
    instructor: {
      name: string
    }
    prerequisites: {
      courses: string[]
    }
  }
}

class myCourse implements Course {
  description = {
    name: "",
    instructor: {
      name: "",
    },
    prerequisites: {
      courses: [],
    },
  }
}
```

## Nesting Interfaces Inside an Interface

Since interfaces are composable, TypeScript allows you to nest interfaces within an interface.

```typescript
// Date is composed of primitive types
interface Date {
  month: number
  day: number
  year: number
}

// Passport is composed of primitive types and nested with another interface
interface Passport {
  id: string
  name: string
  citizenship: string
  expiration: Date
}

// Ticket is composed of primitive types and nested with another interface
interface Ticket {
  seat: string
  expiration: Date
}

// TravelDocument is nested with two other interfaces
interface TravelDocument {
  passport: Passport
  ticket: Ticket
}
```

## Interface Inheritance

Like JavaScript classes, an interface can inherit properties and methods from another interface using the extends keyword. Members from the inherited interface are accessible in the new interface.

```typescript
interface Brand {
  brand: string
}

// Model inherits property from Brand
interface Model extends Brand {
  model: string
}

// Car has a Model interface
class Car implements Model {
  brand
  model
  constructor(brand: string, model: string) {
    this.brand = brand
    this.model = model
  }
  log() {
    console.log(`Drive a ${this.brand} ${this.model} today!`)
  }
}

const myCar: Car = new Car("Nissan", "Sentra")
myCar.log() // Prints "Drive a Nissan Sentra today!"
```

## Interface Index Signature

Property names of an object are assumed to be strings, but they can also be numbers.

If you donâ€™t know in advance the types of these property names, TypeScript allows you to use an index signature to specify the type for the property name inside an object.

To specify an index signature, use square brackets, [...], to surround the type notation for the property name.

```typescript
interface Code {
  [code: number]: string
}
const codeToStates: Code = { 603: "NH", 617: "MA" }

interface ReverseCode {
  [code: string]: number
}
const stateToCodes: ReverseCode = { NH: 603, MA: 617 }
```

## Interface Optional Properties

TypeScript allows you to specify optional properties inside an interface.

This is useful in situations where not all object properties have values assigned to them.

To indicate if a property is optional, append a ? symbol after the property name before the colon, :.

```typescript
interface Profile {
  name: string
  age: number
  hobbies?: string[]
}

// The property, hobbies, is optional, but name and age are required.
const teacher: Profile = { name: "Tom Sawyer", age: 18 }
```
